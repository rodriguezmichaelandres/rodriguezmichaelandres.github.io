    <h2>Software Engineering</h2>
	<p>Software engineers are the technical minds behind computing programs, 
	systems, and networks. Engineers are present at every stage of software 
	creation, including design, development, testing, and evaluation. They 
	also review market research to determine which software products and 
	services are in highest demand, and may need to revisit their work to 
	address glitches and other program errors. Most software engineers are 
	well-versed in computer science and programming, as well as other related 
	fields like web development, digital design, and project management.</p>
	<p>Software engineers often begin their careers by earning a bachelorâ€™s 
	degree from an accredited college or university. These degree programs 
	cover computer science, programming languages, systems analysis, 
	computing architecture, quality assurance, and database management.</p>

	<h2>Web Design</h2>
	<p>In bachelor's degree programs in web design, students study topics 
	such as website construction, object-oriented programming and graphics. 
	Programs that teach web design within the broader structure of a graphic
	or communication degree will likely offer courses in both print-based 
	and Web-based design. In addition to classroom and hands-on instruction 
	in design fundamentals, this program also emphasizes the legal aspects 
	of web design, such as copyright, intellectual property and ethical 
	standards. Students may receive training in areas such as Search Engine 
	Optimization (SEO), analytics and AdWords. Other topics may include: 
	Typography, HTML and CSS, Drawing, 2-D design, Digital art, Ad layout </p>

	<h2>Business Management</h2>
	<p>The Business Management & Enterprise program is designed to prepare 
	you to be a future entrepreneur, with the skills and knowledge to start 
	your own business or to run departments within larger companies. The 
	program presents a general business outlook while developing your 
	integrated perspective of business. This program helps create a compelling
	personal point of view which will help you land your leading role. You 
	will also develop your skills in team project planning, launches, and

	<h2>Biotechnology</h2>
	<p>The primary responsibility of a bioinformatics specialist is to design, 
	develop and use tools for gaining information about biotech procedures. 
	In addition, bioinformaticians must implement these tools and analyze 
	the data obtained from them. This career requires a PhD in biotechnology 
	with a focus on bioinformatics, informatics, computational biology, 
	molecular biology, and/or genomics. In certain cases, the PhD requirement 
	for these jobs may be waived if the candidate can demonstrate comparable
	experience in the field. Fluency in several programming languages is a must.</p>
